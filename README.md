# EAB
Effectiveness of Advanced Bases baseball index.
Hello folks, this is a web page, still in its early stages, designed to show the EAB baseball index (Effectiveness of Advanced Bases). For now if you are interested in the definition of EAB you have to go by the book ISBN 9781494418090. EAB compiles ALL statistics of a player, both defensive and offensive, as well as pitching stats in case of pitchers. In reality, the calculation made in this webpage is insufficient due to the lack of information, the way it was done in here is just a scratch in the surface, if you want to go deep you should read the book and wait a bit longer for the next versions to come. EAB calculated with the data taken from mlb.com is: ( Total Bases + SB - CS + BB + (RBI - HR) + ROE - GIDP + SH + SF + HBP ) / (AP * 4).
